1. We have 1000 users. Now we have a new feature (increase the size of the “like” button). 
We plan to roll out this feature to all of users, but gradually. Here’s our method:

Day 1, we pick 10 random users, show them the new button.
Day 2, we pick another 10 users, show them the new button.
…
Day 100, we pick the rest of 10 users, show them the new button.

Question: how many days does it take for an average user to be picked?


E[X]=1*10/1000+2*10/1000…..+100*10/1000=50.5


2. Now you have a list of 1000 numbers. How do you find out the outliers of these numbers? 
(Write answer in English, do not write any codes.)

Depends on metric. We may need to find mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ). 
Pick the minimum and maximum numbers, any number is not within this segment will be outliers.


3. There are 10 coins. We know that 1 is biased, 9 are fair. The biased coin has p=0.8 to be head. 
I picked up one coin and toss it 3 times: head, head, and tail. 
What’s the probability that the coin I picked is the biased one? (Bayes’s theorem)

Bayes’s theorem: p(A|B) = p(B|A)*p(A) / p(B)
P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and B) = P(A|B)P(B) + P(A|B)P(B)

Result is HHT
P(biased coin) = 0.1
P(unbiased coin) = 1-0.1=0.9

p(choose biased coin | HHT) = 
P(HHT | choose biased coin ) * p(choose biased coin) / p(HHT)
= (0.8*0.8*0.2)*0.1 / p(HHT|biased)*p(biased) + p(HHT|unbiased)*p(unbiased)
= (0.8*0.8*0.2)*0.1/ [(0.8*0.8*0.2)*0.1 + (0.5*0.5*0.5)*0.9]
= 128/1253
= 10.21%


4. You are BA in the email marketing group at Amazon. Say the product marketing manager (PMM) wants to run an email campaign. 
What are some of the metrics you want to look at? Which metric do you think is the most important/relevant?  
(Write down what metrics you chose and why.)

Need to find out some rate related to email activities, such as open email rate, click link rate, purchase rate



5.  Before running A/B tests, we need to figure out how many samples are needed to achieve a certain level of statistical power. 
What are some of the ways to reduce required sample size? (
Write down your answer and why; don’t have to write mathematical formula.) 


Use p (power) , μ (mean), σ (standard deviation) and α (type I error) to calculate sample size.
To reduce sample size, we can do:
Decrease power (want 70% confidence, instead of 80%)
Increase the level of uplift you want to detect (detect 10% difference, not 5%)
Increase the magnitude of effect (μ1-μ2)
Increase the value of α (normally 5%)
Subset on population (filter out ineligible users)
Change to a less volatile metric (σ standard deviation is smaller)
Run longer (assume not too many repeated users)
